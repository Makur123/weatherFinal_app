- **Configuration Management**: Added `.streamlit/config.toml` for deployment optimization

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Session State Management
```python
def init_session_state():
    """Initialize session state with defensive defaults"""
    # Force clear any corrupted session state
    for key in ['dark_mode', 'voice_enabled']:
        if key not in st.session_state:
            st.session_state[key] = False
    
    # Double-check initialization
    if not hasattr(st.session_state, 'dark_mode'):
        st.session_state.dark_mode = False
    if not hasattr(st.session_state, 'voice_enabled'):
        st.session_state.voice_enabled = False
```

### Defensive Access Patterns
```python
# Safe session state access
dark_mode_state = getattr(st.session_state, 'dark_mode', False) if hasattr(st.session_state, 'dark_mode') else False
voice_enabled_state = getattr(st.session_state, 'voice_enabled', False) if hasattr(st.session_state, 'voice_enabled') else False
```
