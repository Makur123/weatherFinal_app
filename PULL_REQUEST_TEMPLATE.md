        if key not in st.session_state:
            st.session_state[key] = False
```

### Cloud-Compatible Voice System
```javascript
// Automatic cloud TTS detection and implementation
const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(voice_text);
utterance.lang = 'ar-SA';  // Arabic language support
speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);
```
